# Persona 5–Inspired Portfolio Website

## Design Document

---

## 1. Design Goal & Experience Pillars

### Primary Goal

Create a portfolio website that **feels like navigating a game UI**, specifically inspired by *Persona 5*’s bold, rebellious, high-contrast visual language—while clearly communicating Ezaz’s skill as a **Full Stack Game Designer**.

### Experience Pillars

1. **Stylish Rebellion** – Loud, confident, anti-generic
2. **Clarity Through Contrast** – Bold shapes + readable structure
3. **Kinetic UI** – Motion as communication, not decoration
4. **Designer-First Thinking** – Systems, logic, and intent are visible

The site should feel like the user has entered *Ezaz’s Palace*.

---

## 2. Visual Language Breakdown (Persona 5 Reference)

### 2.1 Core Aesthetic Traits

Derived from the provided Persona 5 UI references:

* Asymmetrical layouts
* Jagged, torn-paper style panels
* High-contrast black, white, and red
* Text framed inside aggressive geometric shapes
* UI that feels *hand-cut* rather than perfectly aligned

Nothing should feel centered or calm by default.

---

## 3. Color System

### Primary Colors

* **Crimson Red** – Energy, rebellion, highlights
* **Pure Black** – Base background, negative space
* **Off-White / Cream** – Text panels, contrast surfaces

### Accent Colors (Contextual Use)

* **Cyan / Teal** – Interactive prompts (e.g., “Press Any Button”)
* **Yellow** – Warnings, emphasis, CTA moments

### Usage Rules

* Red should *lead* the eye, not flood the screen
* White/cream is reserved for readable content panels
* Black dominates backgrounds

---

## 4. Typography System

### Display Typography (Persona-Inspired)

**Usage:**

* Page titles
* Navigation labels
* Section headers

**Characteristics:**

* Bold
* Angular
* Slightly irregular baselines
* Large font sizes

Text should feel like it’s shouting a message.

### Body Typography

**Usage:**

* Descriptions
* GDD content
* Case studies

**Characteristics:**

* Clean sans-serif
* High readability
* Neutral personality to balance loud headers

### Typography Rules

* Mix large display text with compact body text
* Allow overlaps between text and shapes
* Do not over-align; slight chaos is intentional

---

## 5. Shape & Layout Language

### Panels & Containers

Inspired by Persona menus and character info screens:

* Slanted rectangles
* Overlapping layers
* Thick outlines
* Sharp corners

Avoid rounded cards and soft shadows.

### Composition Philosophy

* Left-heavy or diagonal compositions
* Text blocks framed aggressively
* Images partially cropped or masked

The layout should feel *designed*, not templated.

---

## 6. Motion & Interaction Design

### Interaction Principles

Motion should:

* Guide attention
* Reinforce hierarchy
* Provide feedback

### Key Motion Patterns

* **Page Transitions:** Hard cuts, diagonal wipes, slide-ins
* **Hover States:** Text shifts, color inversion, panel expansion
* **Menu Animations:** Persona-style snap-open menus

### Example Interactions

* Hovering a project card causes:

  * Red panel slide-in
  * Title snapping into place
* Navigating pages feels like switching game screens

---

## 7. Navigation Design

### Navigation Style

* Minimal persistent navigation
* Persona-inspired menu list
* Large clickable items

### Navigation Items

* About / Contact
* Released Games
* Design Documents
* Game Breakdowns

Navigation should feel intentional, not hidden.

---

## 8. Page-Level Design Direction

### 8.1 Landing Page — About Me + Contact

**Visual Tone:** Calling Card

**Design Elements:**

* Huge name typography
* Persona-style tagline panel
* Slanted intro text blocks
* Bold CTA buttons

**Emotional Goal:**
“This person knows who they are.”

---

### 8.2 Released Games Page

**Visual Tone:** Dossier / Case File

**Design Elements:**

* Game cards styled like Persona menus
* Expand-on-click details
* Video framed in aggressive borders

**Emotional Goal:**
“This is real, shipped work.”

---

### 8.3 Design Documents (GDD Page)

**Visual Tone:** Designer’s Notebook

**Design Elements:**

* Tabbed sections
* Large section headers
* Scrollable document panels

**Emotional Goal:**
“This person thinks in systems.”

---

### 8.4 Game Breakdowns Page

**Visual Tone:** Analysis Room

**Design Elements:**

* Annotated screenshots
* Callout panels
* Visual diagrams

**Emotional Goal:**
“This person understands *why* games work.”

---

## 9. Accessibility & Readability Guardrails

Despite the bold style:

* Maintain WCAG-compliant contrast
* Avoid motion overload
* Ensure text remains readable on all devices

Chaos is visual, not functional.

---

## 10. Final Design Philosophy Statement

This website is not pretending to be Persona 5.

It **borrows its visual language** to communicate:

* Confidence
* Taste
* Intentional design thinking

The portfolio itself should feel like a **designed system**—a playable UI that represents Ezaz as a designer who understands interaction at every level.

---

*If this site were a game menu, it should make the user want to press “Start”.*
