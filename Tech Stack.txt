# Persona 5–Inspired Portfolio Website

## Technical Stack Documentation

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **recommended technology stack** for building Ezaz’s Persona 5–inspired portfolio website. The stack is chosen to support:

* High-impact animations
* Sharp UI transitions
* Component-driven design
* Excellent performance
* Long-term maintainability

This is written as if the project were being reviewed by a senior frontend engineer or a technical art lead.

---

## 2. Core Technical Requirements

The portfolio must support:

* Complex UI animations (Persona-style transitions)
* High-contrast, non-standard layouts
* Fast load times despite visual richness
* Easy iteration on content (games, GDDs, breakdowns)
* Clean separation of logic, visuals, and content

The stack must *enable expression*, not limit it.

---

## 3. Recommended Architecture Overview

**Architecture Type:**

* Modern frontend SPA with static generation

**High-Level Flow:**

* Static build for performance
* Client-side animation orchestration
* Content-driven components

This ensures the site feels like a **game UI**, not a CMS page.

---

## 4. Frontend Stack

### 4.1 Framework: Next.js (React)

**Why Next.js:**

* Industry-standard
* Static Site Generation (SSG) for speed
* Excellent routing for page transitions
* Strong recruiter familiarity

**Usage:**

* Page routing
* Layout composition
* Component structure

---

### 4.2 Language: TypeScript

**Why TypeScript:**

* Safer refactors
* Self-documenting components
* Professional-grade codebase

**Usage:**

* Component props
* Data models (Projects, GDDs, Breakdowns)

---

## 5. Styling & Layout System

### 5.1 Styling: Tailwind CSS

**Why Tailwind:**

* Rapid iteration
* Strong control over spacing and layout
* Encourages intentional design

**Usage:**

* Utility-first layout control
* Responsive behavior
* High-contrast theming

**Persona-Specific Use:**

* Aggressive margins and offsets
* Custom utility classes for slanted panels

---

### 5.2 Design Tokens

**Tokens Defined:**

* Colors (Red, Black, Cream, Accent)
* Font sizes
* Spacing units
* Animation timing curves

Tokens ensure visual consistency across chaotic layouts.

---

## 6. Animation & Interaction Layer

### 6.1 Animation Library: Framer Motion

**Why Framer Motion:**

* Declarative animations
* Complex sequencing support
* Smooth page transitions

**Usage:**

* Page enter/exit animations
* Hover states
* Menu transitions

**Persona-Specific Patterns:**

* Directional slide-ins
* Snap animations
* Hard cuts with easing

---

### 6.2 Scroll Animations

**Tool:** Framer Motion (scroll hooks)

**Usage:**

* Section reveals
* Storytelling flows in Game Breakdowns

Avoid excessive parallax; Persona favors *snappy* motion.

---

## 7. Media Handling

### 7.1 Video

**Tooling:**

* Native HTML5 video
* Optimized MP4 / WebM

**Usage:**

* Game trailers
* Gameplay snippets

Videos should autoplay muted on interaction, not on page load.

---

### 7.2 Images

**Tool:** Next.js Image Component

**Usage:**

* Automatic optimization
* Lazy loading
* Responsive sizing

Important for annotated breakdown visuals.

---

## 8. Content Management Strategy

### 8.1 Content Source: Local Markdown / JSON

**Why:**

* Version-controlled
* Easy iteration
* No CMS dependency

**Content Types:**

* Released games
* Design documents
* Game breakdown articles

This reinforces a *designer-developer* identity.

---

### 8.2 Optional Headless CMS (Future)

**Examples:**

* Sanity
* Contentful

Only introduce if content volume grows significantly.

---

## 9. Accessibility & Performance

### 9.1 Accessibility

* Semantic HTML
* Keyboard navigation
* Motion-reduced mode support

Persona-style visuals should never block usability.

---

### 9.2 Performance Optimization

* Static builds
* Code splitting
* Lazy-loaded animations
* Asset compression

Target: Sub-2s initial load on desktop.

---

## 10. Hosting & Deployment

### 10.1 Hosting Platform: Vercel

**Why:**

* Native Next.js support
* Fast global CDN
* Easy deployments

---

### 10.2 CI/CD

* Automatic builds on Git push
* Preview deployments for iteration

Feels like shipping a live product, not a static site.

---

## 11. Tooling & Developer Experience

### 11.1 Code Quality

* ESLint
* Prettier

Keeps chaos intentional.

---

### 11.2 Version Control

* Git + GitHub
* Feature-based commits

Shows professional workflow.

---

## 12. Optional Enhancements (Nice-to-Have)

* Sound effects toggle (Web Audio API)
* Theme switcher (Alt Persona palette)
* Interactive micro-experiments

Only if performance remains clean.

---

## 13. Why This Stack Fits the Portfolio

This stack:

* Supports bold UI experimentation
* Demonstrates real-world engineering discipline
* Aligns with modern game-adjacent frontend workflows

It communicates that Ezaz is not just a designer—but someone who understands **systems, tooling, and execution**.

---

## 14. Final Note

The technology should never overpower the design—but it must be capable of **keeping up with it**.

This stack ensures the portfolio feels like a *playable interface*, not a webpage.
